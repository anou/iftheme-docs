Lightbox Plus ColorBox permits users to view larger versions of images, simple slide shows, videos and content all in an overlay.

== Description ==

Lightbox Plus ColorBox implements ColorBox as a lightbox image overlay tool for WordPress.  <a href="http://www.jacklmoore.com/colorbox">ColorBox</a> was created by Jack Moore and is licensed under the <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php">MIT License</a>.  Lightbox Plus ColorBox for WordPress implements ColorBox as a lightbox image overlay tool for WordPress. ColorBox was created by Jack Moore and is licensed under the MIT License. Lightbox Plus ColorBox permits users to view larger versions of images without having to leave the current page. Lightbox is able to add a lightbox to WordPress gallery images, display simple slide shows, video, forms and external content in overlays. The use of the dark or light background, which dims the page over which the image has been overlaid, also serves to highlight the image or video being viewed. Lightbox Plus ColorBox captures the image title for display in the overlay.

Lightbox Plus ColorBox uses WordPress' built in jQuery library. Lightbox Plus ColorBox also uses the <a href="http://simplehtmldom.sourceforge.net/" title="PHP Simple HTML DOM Parser">PHP Simple HTML DOM Parser</a> helper class to navigate page content for inserting the Lightbox attibutes into elements.

= Troubleshooting =

Please read the <a href="http://www.23systems.net/plugins/lightbox-plus/frequently-asked-questions/">FAQ</a> first if you are having problems.

We offer limited support for Lightbox Plus ColorBox via the <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/lightbox-plus" title="Lightbox Plus ColorBox Direct Support">support forums</a>. 

For more in-depth support or if you need extra help you may place a service request using the form on the <a title="Get technical support for 23Systems free WordPress plugins" href="http://www.23systems.net/services/support/plugin-support/">Plugin Support Request</a> page.  Due to the volume of questions, I cannot may not be able to offer individual support though in an effort to resolve the issue I may contact you. The issue may be resolved by a new release of Lightbox Plus ColorBox but it does help me get a better understanding of the issue.

= Requirements =

Server

* WordPress 3.0+
* PHP 5+ (Required)
 * PHP mbstring extension (preferred but no longer required)
* jQuery 1.4.3+

Support for PHP 4 has been completely removed - DO NOT UPDATE if you want Lightbox Plus ColorBox to work with PHP 4.

Client

* IE 7+, Firefox 2+, Chrome, Safari 3+, Opera 8+

= Usage =

Note that getting the caption to appear in the overlay image by using the caption options built into WordPress Lightbox Plus ColorBox uses the image title which is generated by "Edit Image Title" field and not the "Edit Caption Field."  You can also manually add lightbox tags to your images using the following instructions.

1. Add a rel="lightbox[uniqueID|filename]" attribute to any link tag to activate the lightbox, include a name between square brackets in the rel attibute. For example:

        <a href="images/image-1.jpg" rel="lightbox[uniqueID|filename]" title="my caption">image #1</a>

Optional: Use the title attribute if you want to show a caption.

2. If you have a set of related images that you would like to group, follow step one but additionally include a group name between square brackets in the rel attribute. For example:

        <a href="images/image-1.jpg" rel="lightbox[roadtrip]">image #1</a>
        <a href="images/image-2.jpg" rel="lightbox[roadtrip]">image #2</a>
        <a href="images/image-3.jpg" rel="lightbox[roadtrip]">image #3</a>

= Caveats =

Flash (i.e. YouTube videos, etc.) will sit atop the Lightbox Plus ColorBox display no matter what the z-index is.  This is an issue with Flash.

See <a href="http://go.adobe.com/kb/ts_tn_15523_en-us">Flash content displays on top of all DHTML layers</a> at Adobe for details.

To work around this issue you will need to add something like the following to your <code>&lt;param /&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;embed&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;</code> tags:
<code>
        &lt;object&gt;&lt;param name="wmode" value="opaque" /&gt;&lt;embed wmode="opaque" [all other embed settings, file src etc.]&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;
</code>

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Lightbox Plus ColorBox doesn't work =

Well, yes, it does.  It's used by thousands of websites and if it doesn't work for you that because there is some problem with how it interacts with your site.

The most common cause for it not working is a jQuery conflict cause by a theme or a plugin that either does not properly instantiate jQuery or instantiate s avery old version of jQuery.

Here are things to try in order to see what the problem is.

1. Check jQuery version and make sure you are using the lastest included in WordPress
 * If it's an older version or not enqueued correctly it will cause problems
 * It may be in your theme or another plugin
2. You may be lacking <code>wp_footer()</code> function in your <code>footer.php</code> of your WordPress theme.
 * Look at the default theme to see how it is implemented and add it into your theme.
3. Try deactivating all plugins one at a time besides lightbox plus and see if if it starts working
 * If it does work after deactivating on then there's a plugin conflict
4. If deactivating plugins doesn't work then there might be a conflict with your theme
 * To isolate you can try an different theme and see if it works
5. Try changing to a different lightbox style/theme and see if that makes a difference
 * There may be a style conflict of some sort
6. Try deleting the plugin and reinstalling - it may have not completely updated correctly.
 * You'll have to reset your settings so you might want to write them down.
 
= It works for some images and not others, why not? =

The problem may be with your WordPress theme, mangling image display properties. Try using another theme, that doesn't interfere with posted images.

It also seems that some more recent version of WordPress (or perhaps the plugin is causing this in some way I am not aware of) do not automatically add the link to the full size image.  You must also make sure that when you are adding an image from the WordPress media dialog control you must make sure there is a link to the image in the Link URL field.  The easiest way to get the correct link is to click on the link to image button beneath the field.  <a href="http://www.23systems.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/file.png">Visual depiction</a> of what is required when adding images in order for lightbox to function correctly.

= Lightbox Plus ColorBox doesn't work properly in browser X, Y, or Z (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Opera, Explorer 6, 7, etc.)? =

Yes it probably does, the problems may be the same as above or there may be a conflict with another plugin or a style conflict.  It has been tested in Chrome, IE 7+, Firefox 2+, Chrome, Safari 3+, Opera 8+ since development began.

= Does Lightbox Plus ColorBox work with PHP 4? If not, why not? =

No it doesn't.  PHP 4 reached end of life on August 8th 2008 (almost years ago.)  WordPress no longer supports PHP 4 and all plugin developers are encourage to follow.  The best solution at this time is to ask your host provider to upgrade to PHP 5.

You will know that Lightbox Plus ColorBox is not working because of PHP if you receive the following error:

<b>Plugin couldn't be activated because of fatal error</b>

<code>Parse error: syntax error, unexpected T_OBJECT_OPERATOR in /path/to/plugin/classes/filters.class.php on line 81</code>

= Can I use this plugin and Lightview Plus, Lightbox 2 (either one), jQuery Colorbox, WP lightbox JS Plugin, Fancybox etc at the same time? =

Maybe, but probably not as they will most likely interfere with each other as they usually modify the image URLs.  Other image overlay plugins may possibly be compatible.

= Can I add my own styles and images for the overlay? =

Yes, you can easily create additional styles by checking the use custom styles checkbox.  It will copy the existing styles to <code>wp-content/lbp-css</code> and you can modify any of the existing styles.  You can all adding a new folder to that directory and using the existing styles as examples create your completely custom styles.

= How does Lightbox Plus ColorBox differ from other Lightbox plugins for WordPress? =

Performance wise the ColorBox jQuery plugin is smaller and generally faster and has more options than most lightbox JavaScript plugins.  The regular expressions that handle the text are more robust handling a wider variety of characters and in addition it will also grab the image title from the image to use for the overlay image caption.

= Does Lightbox Plus ColorBox work with WordPress' built in gallery =

Yes it does.  There are few simple requirements however.  You must set <strong>Link thumbnails to: Image File</strong> or use <code>[gallery link="file"</code> for the gallery options.  You must check <em>Use For WP Gallery</em> box under <strong>Other Lightbox Plus ColorBox Settings</strong>

= When resetting/re-initializing LBP the setting do not appear correctly when the page reloads, what gives? =

This problem is only apparent in Chrome and Opera.  It seems to works fine in Internet Explorer, Firefox and Safari.  There are some browser related issues and I am investigating the problem at this time.  For Chrome the settings are being saved but not displayed immediately, click on the Lightbox Plus ColorBox link under appearance and you will see the current settings.  Opera for whatever reason is completely failing to save re-initialization settings, you must manually set and save them or use another browser.  And, no, it doesn't make sense since it's server side activity.

= Additional FAQs from Colorbox =

For addtional information please see <a href="http://www.jacklmoore.com/colorbox/faq" title="ColorBox FAQ">ColorBox FAQ</a> for information about the jQuery plugin used by Lightbox Plus ColorBox.

= Other Problems =

If your problem isn't covered in this FAQ, your best bet would be to post your question to the WordPress <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/lightbox-plus" title="Lightbox Plus ColorBox Forum Support">support forums</a>.

<strong>Please do not contact Jack Moore the author of ColorBox for issues with Lightbox Plus ColorBox.</strong>

If you have read and tried the above and you are still having problems, and require more in-depth support or if you need extra help you may place a service request using the form on the <a title="Get technical support for 23Systems free WordPress plugins" href="http://www.23systems.net/services/support/plugin-support/">Plugin Support Request</a> page.  Due to the volume of questions, I cannot may not be able to offer individual support though in an effort to resolve the issue I may contact you. The issue may be resolved by a new release of Lightbox Plus ColorBox but it does help me get a better understanding of the issue.

= Known Problems =

* Does not work correctly with W3 Total Cache if you are using automatic minify settings.  You can manually set up minify to work correctly bypassing Lightbox Plus ColorBox (jquery-colorbox.min.js)
* No support for iPad (if someone wants to donate an iPad to me I will guarantee support)
 * It generally seems to work though I just don't support it as I don't have an iPad.
* In some instances performance may be slow in older versions IE - this may be due to plugin conflicts or slow JavaScript performance in IE.
* Lightboxed video does not seem to work in IE on locally installed sites, for example viewing in IE 7.0 while running XAMPP, this seems to be a Windows only issue.

= Plugin Conflicts =

* Jetpack Carousel - When carousel is activate it take precedence over Lightbox Plus ColorBox for image use as of LBP 2.x
* Flickr Mini Gallery - Verified.  Download hot fix for <a href="http://23systems.net/downloads/file/flickr-mini-gallery-jquery-hotfix.zip">Flickr Mini Gallery</a> (includes instructions) as of LBP 1.6.3
* Tabbed Widgets - Verified as of LBP 1.6.3
* DMSGuestbook - Un-verified as of LBP 1.6.3
* Gengo - Un-verified as of LBP 1.6.3

Note: Some of these conflicts were with very old versions of Lightbox Plus ColorBox and may be mitigated

 * Added property "data" to specify GET or POST data when using Ajax.  ColorBox's ajax functionality is handled by jQuery's .load() method, so the data property works the same way as it does with .load().
 * Added property "fixed" which can provide fixed positioning for ColorBox, rather than absolute positioning.  This will allow ColorBox to remain in a fixed position within the visitors viewport, despite scrolling.  IE6 support for this was not added, it will continue to use the default absolute positioning.
 * Fixed ClearType problem with IE7.
 * Minor fixes.
* Updated ColorBox to verion 1.3.16

= 2.2.2 =
* Corrected load_plugin_textdomain function calls, had incorrect number of arguments - Thanks Johannes!

* Updated ColorBox to verion 1.3.15
 * In IE6, closing an iframe when using HTTPS no longer generates a security warning.
 * Changed the index.html example files to use YouTube's new embedded link format.
 * By default, ColorBox returns focus to the element it was launched from once it closes.  This can now be disabled by setting the 'returnFocus' property to false.  Focus was causing problems for some users who had their anchor elements inside animated containers.
 * Minor bug fix involved in using a combination of slideshow and non-slideshow content.
 * Minor bug fix involved in preloading images when using a function as a value for the href property.
 * The slideshow now respects the loop property.
 * Fixed compatibility with jQuery 1.4.3
 * The 'open' property now accepts a function as a value, like all of the other properties.
 * Preloading now loads the correct href for images when using a dynamic (function) value for the href property.
 * Fixed bug in Safari 3 for Win where ColorBox centered on the document, rather than the visitor's viewport.
 * May have fixed an issue in Opera 10.6+ where ColorBox would rarely/randomly freeze up while switching between photos in a group.
 * Some functionality better encapsulated & minor performance improvements.

= 2.2 =
* Fixed "Object id #", "Object", "Object #" errors with PHP 5.1.x.
 * Problem was due to circular memory leak in PHP 5.1 and 5.2 and HTML DOM object not being cleaned up.
 * Altered way the content is returned to allow for closure and cleaning of object sooner eliminating memory leak.
* Due to overwhelming demand I added PHP 4 functionality back in but it is not officially supported.
 * If you were seeing an error that looked something like `Parse error: syntax error, unexpected T_STRING, expecting T_OLD_FUNCTION or T_FUNCTION or T_VAR or '}' in /path/to/plugins/lightbox-plus/classes/shd.class.php on line 86` you have PHP 4.
 * Option is automatically set to use legacy method if you have PHP 4
 * You will have to manually select the option to use the <em>PHP 4 Auto Lightbox Method</em> if you are using PHP 5.X and wish to use legacy method.
* Fix for images with upper case file extension not being auto-lightboxed.
* Probable fix for `XML Parsing Error: no element found` likely caused by memory leak
 * Unable to reproduce error but research indicates memory leak is a likely cause.

= 2.1 =
* Now requires PHP 5+, no PHP 4 support.
 * PHP4 reached its end of life on 8/8/2008 nearly 2 years ago.
* Fixed problems with initialization and re-initialization of the plugin not working under various circumstances.
 * Add code for activation/deactivation of the plugin
* Added true HTML parser instead of regular expressions
 * Using <a href="http://simplehtmldom.sourceforge.net/">PHP Simple HTML DOM Parser</a> for parsing HTML
 * Should mitigate issues of not consuming the HTML content and correctly modifying it
* Change method for finding and selecting styles
 * Added option for stylesheet directory to reside outside of plugin directory
 * Lightbox Plus no longer stores stylesheet path in options, it is now pulled from global definitions
 * It should now be easier to use on multiple servers with different paths.
* Added support for multiple galleries on a single page displaying separate slide shows
* Updated ColorBox to version 1.3.9
 * Fixed a bug in IE where iframed YouTube videos were not opening correctly.

= 2.0.5 =

* Rewrote several functions to provide better compatibility with other plugins.
 * Admin scripts are now enqueued correctly.
 * Admin and plugin styles are now enqueued correctly.
* Fixed slideshow always auto-starting if slideshow enabled.
* Changed several variables and related fields
 * <em>Do Not Auto-Lightbox Images</em> using `auto_lightbox` to `no_auto_lightbox` to accurately reflect its use.
 * <em>Do Not Display Image Title</em> using `display_titles` to `no_display_titles` to accurately reflect its use.
 * <em>Use Class Method using</em> `class_method` to `use_class_method` to accurately reflect it's use.
 * If you use any of these settings you will need to re-check them and save your settings.
* Reduced size of inline JavaScript and converted all to jQuery.
 * Reduced size of some scripts using old toggle method for help.

= 2.0.2 =
* Add quick fix/hack for a big interface issue on the admin panel. See roadmap for long term solution.
 * jQuery UI themes were overloading other plugins that were using the jQuery UI
 * Lightbox Plus specific themes and scripts should only load on Lightbox Plus panel
 * The exception is colorbox.min.js will load in any admin panel due to the way it is initialized. Expect version 2.0.5 to address this.

= 2.0.1 =
* Fixed several interface issues in the admin panel.
 * User feedback was not reporting updates because admin scripts were not loading properly - this has been fixed.

= 2.0 =
* Added secondary lightbox option
 * There is no auto-lightboxing for the secondary lightbox
 * Allows the creation of a secondary lightbox with iframe capabilities
 * Allows lightboxing of video, flash, and content that resides elsewhere
* Added inline lightbox options

 * Provides demos and examples for secondary lightbox using video, external webpages and interactive flash
 * Provides demos and examples for inline lightbox using inline content
* Fixed issue with saving setting and changes not being reflected.
* Updated ColorBox to version 1.3.8
 * Fixed a bug in Chrome where it would sometimes render photos at 0 by 0 width and height (behavior introduced in recent update to Chrome).
 * Fixed a bug where the onClosed callback would fire twice (only affected 1.3.7).
 * Fixed a bug in IE7 that existed with some iframed websites that use JS to reposition the viewport caused ColorBox to move out of position.
 * Abstracted the identifiers (HTML ids & classes, and JS plugin name, method, and events) so that the plugin can be easily rebranded.
 * Small changes to improve either code readability or compression.

= 1.7 =
* Updated ColorBox to verion 1.3.7
 * $.colorbox can now be used for direct calls and accessing public methods.  Example: $.colorbox.close();
 * Resize now accepts 'width', 'innerWidth', 'height' and 'innerHeight'. Example: $.colorbox.resize({width:"100%"})
 * Added option (loop:false) to disable looping in a group.
 * Added options (escKey:false, arrowKey:false) to disable esc-key and arrow-key bindings.
 * Added method for removing ColorBox from a document: $.colorbox.remove();
 * Fixed a bug where iframed URLs would be truncated if they contained an unencoded apostrophe.
 * Now uses the exact href specified on an anchor, rather than the version returned by 'this.href'. This was causing "#example" to be normalized to "http://domain/#example" which interfered with how some users were setting up links to inline content.

= 1.6.9.7 =
* Fixed auto-lightbox breaking links that contained manually created `rel="lightbox[]"` attributes.

= 1.6.9.6 =
* Skipping of auto-lightboxing of second image when image links were next to each other in html source should be fixed. At least in my testing.
* Fixed do not display image titles to work with text links.
 * Note - must already not have title tag in links elements.
* Fixed ability to use class method in text only links and gallery.
* Added ability to specify the class name used with class method.  Defaults to cboxModal for the class.
* Changed jQuery implementation of colorbox on the page to both reduce size and prepare for allowing two different colorboxes. (See Road Map)

= 1.6.9.5 =
* No really, the IE problems should be resolved.
 * Correctly handle new settings when empty to render correct JavaScript on output - was causing IE to not display lightbox and weird sliding effect on lightbox in all browsers.
 * Fixed invalid function call that would prevent older versions of IE (7 or less) from rendering lightbox at all.
* Fixed issue that if admin was being accessed via SSL you could not save settings.
* Fixed some skipping of images being auto-lightboxed.  May not resolve all issues - please let me know at <href="http://www.23systems.net/bbpress/forum/lightbox-plus">Lightbox Plus Support</a>.

= 1.6.9 =
* Fixed problem with styles in IE 6/7/8 not working under various circumstances (hopefully)
* Added the option to disable Lightbox Plus from adding its own styles allowing the user to place Lightbox/Colorbox styles in their theme stylesheet and reduce number of files loading.

= 1.6.8 =
* Fixed duplicate `rel=lightbox[]` tags being generated.
* Fixed IE 6 specific stylesheets - should provide correct headers for php based css documents.
 * AlphaImageLoader should automatically be configure for old versions of IE - 6 or less
* As of this version IE 6 or less are no longer supported.
 * If you are using IE 6 or less it is recommended that you upgrade your browser.
* Added option to auto-lightbox text links to images
* Added additional width and height options
 * width - can set a fixed total width. This includes borders and buttons.
 * height    - can    set a fixed total height. This includes borders and buttons.
 * innerWidth - This is an alternative to 'width' used to set a fixed inner width. This excludes borders and buttons.
 * innerHeight - This is an alternative to 'height' used to set a fixed inner height. This excludes borders and buttons.
 * initialWidth    - can set the initial width, prior to any content being loaded.
 * initialHeight - can set the initial height, prior to any content being loaded.
* Updated `lightbox.admin.css` and `lightbox.admin.php` to correct a top level class that may effect global styles.
* Now works correctly with WordPress MU
 * Tested with WordPress MU 2.9.2
* Degradation of performance in Firefox corrected.  May still occur in older versions
 * Note: with the release of Firefox 3.0.19 the 3.0.x branch of Firefox will reach its end of life on March 30, 2010

= 1.6.7 =
* Added fix to auto-lightbox images that are missing title attributes (Thanks J?rn)
 * This primarily affects images that were placed using older versions of WordPress
* Interface updates
 * Changed admin panel to work that same way as my other plugins and thereby ease code maintenance
 * Quick links in plugins list
 * Added additional support and FAQ links to admin panel
* Readme and FAQ update
* Actually includes ColorBox 1.3.6 which somehow was replaced by 1.3.1 in last release (1.6.6) for which I apologize.
* Includes `lightbox-plus.pot` for language translations for interested parties.

= 1.6.6 =
* Tested with WordPress 2.9.1
 * Only works with WordPress 2.8+ due to the use of the `$in_footer` parameter used in the `wp_enqueue_script()` function.
* Moved all possible JavaScript to the footer to improve load speed
 * Requires theme has the `wp_footer()` hook
* Cleaned up jQuery call to correctly work in no conflict mode per definition.
* Updated Colorbox to 1.3.6 which include the following fixes
 * Small change to make Colorbox compatible with jQuery 1.4
 * Fixed a bug introduced in 1.3.4 with IE7's display of example 2 and example 3, and auto-width in Opera.
 * Fixed a bug introduced in 1.3.4 where colorbox could not be launched by triggering an element's click event through JavaScript.
 * Minor refinements.
 * Event delegation is now used for elements that ColorBox is assigned to, rather than individual click events.
 * Additional callbacks have been added to represent other stages of ColorBox's lifecycle. Available callbacks, in order of their execution: `onOpen`, `onLoad`, `onComplete`, `onCleanup`, `onClosed` These take place at the same time as the event hooks, but will be better suited than the hooks for targeting specific instances of ColorBox.
 * Ajax content is now immediately added to the DOM to be more compatible if that content contains script tags.
 * Focus is now returned to the calling element on closing.
 * Fixed a bug where `maxHeight` and `maxWidth` did not work for non-photo content.
 * Direct calls no longer need `'open:true'`, it is assumed.  Example: `$.fn.colorbox({html:"<p>Hi</p>"});`
 * Changed `$.fn.colorbox.element()` to return a jQuery object rather the DOM element.
 * jQuery.colorbox-min.js is compressed with Google's Closure Compiler rather than YUI Compressor.
 * Added `'innerWidth'` and `'innerHeight'` options to allow people to easily set the size dimensions for ColorBox, without having to anticipate the size of the borders and buttons.
 * Renamed `'scrollbars'` option to `'scrolling'` to be in keeping with the existing HTML attribute.  The option now also applies to iframes.
 * Bug fix: In Safari, positioning occassionally incorrect when using '100%' dimensions.
 * Bug fix: In IE6, the background overlay is briefly not full size when first viewing.
 * Bug fix: In Firefox, opening ColorBox causes a split second shift with a small minority of webpage layouts.
 * Simplified code in a few areas.
* Special thanks for navjotjsingh for the include, excude fix for WordPress built in gallery

= 1.6.3 =
* Eliminated conflict with Featured Content plug-in
 * Removed `jQuery.noConflict()` due to poor implementation on my part.
 * Kept `$lbp` jQuery variable.
* jQuery conflicts should all be resolved - hopefully.
* Minor modification to `wp_enqueue_script` function cal to include colorbox version.
* Now works with WordPress Mu if `rel=lightbox[]` is added manually.
 * Working on solving auto lightboxing issues with WordPress Mu

= 1.6.2 =
* Added `jQuery.noConflict()` to the initiator to hopefully eliminate issues with other jQuery libraries loading and causing conflicts.
 * Changed jQuery `$` variable to `$lbp` to give a unique constructor.
* Added replacement shortcode gallery method to allow Lightbox Plus to work with shortcode galleries called via the `echo do_shortcode('[gallery link="file" size="thumbnail"]');` method in templates.

 * Added checkbox to select whether to use with WP built in gallery.
* Updated Lightbox Plus to use new version of ColorBox
* Updated ColorBox to version 1.3.1 with the following changes
  * Removed the IE-only stylesheets and conditional comments.  All CSS is handled by a single CSS file for all examples.
  * Removed user-agent sniffing from the js and replaced it with feature detection.  This will allow correct rendering for visitors masking their agent type.
  * Added `$.fn.colorbox.resize()` method to allow ColorBox to resize it's height if it's contents change.
  * Added `scrollbars` option to allow users to turn off scrollbars when using the `resize()` method.
  * Renamed the `resize` option to be less ambiguous.  It's now `scalePhotos`.
  * Renamed the `cbox_close` event to be less ambiguous.  It's now `cbox_cleanup`.  It is the first thing to happen in the close method while the 'cbox_closed' event is the last to happen.

 * Using this method you can manually control which images are affected by Lightbox Plus by adding the cpModal class the image link URL and checking the Don't Auto-Lightbox Images option.
* Added option to not automatically add attributes required for Lightbox Plus to work.  This allows for more manual image control.
* Added option not to display image titles.

* <strong>README!</strong> - If you have custom styles back them up before proceeding.  You will need to convert them to the new directory and ColorBox format to use them again.
