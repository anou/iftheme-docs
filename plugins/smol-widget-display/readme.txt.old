== Localizations ==

BYAD Countdown distributes with translations for the following languages:

* English
* Fran√ßais
* Italiano

Don't see your language on the list?

There is a - byad-countdown-default.po - in the languages/ directory. 

Use it with [Poedit](http://www.poedit.net/) as a base .PO file for your language. 

Save it as: byad-countdown-LANGCODE.po where LANGCODE is your language code (e.g. fr_FR). 

If you create any, I'll be glad to include it in the plugin.
