Creates a 'Coming Soon' page that will show for all users who are not logged in

== Description ==

Creates a 'Coming Soon' page that will show for all users who are not logged in. Useful for developing a site on a live server, without the world being able to see it

== Installation ==

1. Upload the folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. If you want to change the look of the page that is displayed, click Settings->Under Construction and change the settings there.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I'm finished with it, and disabled the plugin, but the "under construction" message is still showing up! =
If you've disabled the plugin, it won't show anything anymore. To be extra super-sure, try deleting the plugin files. Usually, though, the issue is that you're seeing a cached version of the page. Try force-refreshing your browser, and then try clearing your cache on the server and force refreshing again. If you have a caching plugin like W3 Total Cache, make sure you clear that too!

= I can't see the under construction page! =
As long as you're logged in, you won't be able to see it. That's a feature! This way, while you're logged in you can work as usual. To preview what it looks like, either a) log out, or b) try viewing it in another browser

= What kind of HTML can I put in? =
You enter the contents of the entire HTML file. You can include inline styles, or links to external style sheets and external images.

= I have an idea for your plugin! =
That's great. I'm always open to user input, and I'd like to add anything I think will be useful to a lot of people. Visit the homepage for this plugin and leave a comment, and I'll add the functionality as soon as I can.

= I found a bug! =
Oops. That's sure awkward. If you find a problem with this plugin that you can reproduce, if you wouldn't mind leaving a message on the homepage for this plugin with how you made it break, I'd really like to try and fix it! Also, this is incompatible with a couple plugins out there, specifically ones that change the default login url.

= This plugin has helped me a lot, how can I support it? =
I've had a few people ask me this. If you like it, please go to WordPress.org and rate it! Then more people can enjoy it. If you REALLY like it, you can always buy me a coffee. :) There's a donate link on my site.

= You didn't answer my question here =
Sorry, I get a lot of questions. But visit the homepage for this plugin and leave me a comment. They go right to my inbox, and well I might not be able to for a few days, I promise I'll get back to you.
